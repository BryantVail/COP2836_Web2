I also found that other optimizations like caching and 'scaling' images are not executed well here, I would think that's out of convenience. I will say, with these two findings I get curious about how responsive and efficient I will be able to be for the web server when IÂ  get more experience- some of these items seem like they can just be a matter of discipline.
